    <h2>Norman Lee Thoamson</h2>
    <h2>First name "Norman Lee"</h2>
    <h2>Nick name "Sherpa"</h2>
    <p1>I am working on a Bachelors degree (if I remember correctly...) of Professional Studies.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>I'm single. I am a federally appointed caregiver for my younger brother. I am grateful that I am able to take courses from BYU Idaho online.</p1>
    <p1>I like playing mobile games, reading fantasy novels books (I prefer paper books but I have started to take a liking to e-books) and watching YouTube videos. One of my favorite foods is root beer floats</p1>
    <br>

    <p1>In this information age everything from businesses to pet cats have their own websites. While there are many tools out there for people without web development experience to make their own websites, I believe having a background in web development and design can help when creating more professional and custom made websites that might not be achievable through consumer-based website creation softwares.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>I was born in the church and if I had to pick a favorite scripture verse I'd have to go with James chapter 1 verse five "if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and abradedeth is not; and shall be given him". I like this verse because it shows how to gain a testimony of all their Scripture verses.</p1><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>I wish all of you good luck in this semester's course work and in all of your other endeavors.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>God bless.</p>
